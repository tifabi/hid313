        Big Data platform solutions allow data producers to use data to the
        fullest potential by combining processing engines with storage
        solutions and analytic  technologies. Pharmaceutical clients are
        looking into platform solutions to  safely store, analyze, and use
        clinical trial data, experimental data, drug  development studies,
        drug production, regulation, and a number of other outlets.  Just a
        few of the benefits of using a platform solution to manage these data
        outlets are not having to change current work processes, that
        management and  other research groups can access and use data without
        needing special access to  systems, and scalability of storage and
        analytic components is seamless. The  problems faced to implementing
        big data platform solutions include the selection  of a platform
        vendor, the design of appropriate data architecture, and establishing
        effective user interfaces.

        Ground breaking scientific research and development happen in
        laboratories all over the world every day. The recent flux of data has
        revolutionized laboratories across several very different sectors. Many
        laboratories operate at the capacity that require big data tools.
        Exploring the current need for big data tools across several industries
        provides a view of where these tools are currently being applied and
        how they are benefiting the industry as well as where gaps exist.

        While many relate stock market trading to gambling, successful traders
        have turned stock picking into a science. The likes of Warren Buffet
        tell us that successful stock buying is all in the research. So what
        kind of research aids in the prediction of companies within the highly
        volatile pharmaceutical market? The use of available, open-source APIs
        and Google Alerts are used to explore if clinical trial results can
        directly impact stock performance in small, mid, and large cap
        pharmaceutical companies. Key words and/or phrases in results and
        related news articles are identified as possible predictors of market
        effect. As well as a comparison to already established analyst ratings
        from Barclays, Goldman, and J P Morgan Chase which have already been
        shown to impact stock performance.
