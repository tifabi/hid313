  abstract  = {In the present Indian scenario, healthcare information is independently maintained by hospitals, institutions and not readily accessible in a centralized, informed manner. This greatly limits the health providers' efforts to improve quality and efficiency. Through this paper, we address this issue on bringing various information from many sources into one place in realtime which can be truly life saving. Also, low ratio of doctor to patient and the low per capita income in India hikes the medical expenses thereby increasing the patient's inaccessibility to receive proper health care in their reach especially for people in the rural areas. A means by which the bridge between the patients and doctors can be gapped and how patients can be treated at a lower expense is the prime concern. This paper focuses on the development of a mobile/web application, through which patients sends their symptomatic query to the doctors through a server. The mobile application will be equipped with first aid instructions, according to the nature and severity of the symptoms, either the patients are directed to respective departments or given emergency help for further treatment. Within the time huge amount of data is collected from users and doctors, this big data will be used to train machines to automate the tasks to some extent. The information gained from analyzing massive amounts of aggregated health data can provide useful insight to improve quality and efficiency for providers and insurers alike. This makes the patients reach out for healthcare solutions easily and cheaply and makes healthcare a easy reach for the unprivileged also. Thus, this unified model can serve as a data collection, delivery as well as an analytic tool in the healthcare domain.},

Whenever we are in the critical care situation and we are in need of fast results from a complex procedures or problems, big data analytics is the default solution since it does not need much hardware overhead also apart from its performance improvement. There are a number of applications in related with healthcare domain using big data analytics. In this paper, a novel technique of motif discovery for medical big data is studied using Hadoop. Data considered for experiment is taken from real time ECG data of UCR data set. The observed results showed that big data analytics gives better performance when compared to a single data node for motif discovery.},

As a consequence, we are now in the era of massive automatic data collection, systematically obtaining many measurements, not knowing which one will be relevant to the phenomenon of interest.

The traditional data storage techniques are not adequate to store and analyses those huge volume of data. Many researchers are doing their research in dimensionality reduction of the big data for effective and better analytics report and data visualization.

  abstract = {Abstract Servitization has become a pervasive business strategy among manufacturers, enabling them to undergird their competitive advantage. However, it has at least one weakness. While it is used worldwide also in economies with lower production costs, services in manufacturing are slowly becoming commoditized and will become a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for reaching an above average competitive advantage. Consequently, in this article we propose a new basis for competitive advantage for manufacturing enterprises called a Big Data Strategy in servitization. We scrutinize how manufacturers can exploit the opportunity arising from combined Big Data and servitization. Therefore, the concept of a Big Data Strategy framework in servitization is proposed. The findings are benchmarked against established frameworks in the Big Data and servitization literature. Its impact on competitive advantage is assessed through three theoretical perspectives that increase the validity of the results. The main finding is that, through the proposed strategy, new revenue streams can be created, while opening the possibility to decrease prices for product–services. Through the proposed strategy manufacturers can differentiate themselves from the ones that are already servitizing. This article introduces the possibility of influencing the most important of the five “Vs” in Big Data–Value, in addition to the other four “Vs”—Volume, Variety, Velocity and Verification. As in regards to servitization, the article adds a third layer of added value— “information”, beside the two existing ones: product and service. The results have strategic implications for managers.},

The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information.

In traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence techniques to learn features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the first learning stage of the method, sparse filtering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is validated by a motor bearing dataset a},
